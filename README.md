January game for OneGameAMonth #1GAM

Starting with something simple...

This is a kind of 'space-invaders' style game, with the player handling a ship
which moves horizontally at the bottom of the screen, and asteroids (and maybe
other objects) coming down randomly (?) from the top of the screen. The player
has to avoid getting hit, and to build up a score by destroying the asteroids.
