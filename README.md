January game for OneGameAMonth #1GAM

Starting with something simple...

A 'space-invaders' style game, with the player handling a ship which moves
horizontally at the bottom of the screen, and asteroids (and maybe other
objects) coming down randomly (?) from the top of the screen. The player has to
avoid getting hit, and to build up a score by destroying the asteroids.

Dependencies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Python 2.7
* Pygame 1.9.1
