January game for OneGameAMonth #1GAM

Starting with something simple...

A 'space-invaders' style game, with the player handling a ship which moves
horizontally at the bottom of the screen, and asteroids (and maybe other
objects) coming down randomly (?) from the top of the screen. 

The player builds up a score by mining valuable asteroids, while destroying or
avoiding worthless asteroids.

Dependencies

* Python 2.7
* Pygame 1.9.1
